In the end, we decided to do a DR4B robot because the tray robot appeared to be much more common and this way we could stack on top of already made stacks. This also made scoring in multiplying towers much more efficient. At the moment, we have the initial design built and coded however are experiencing issues with the DR4B staying straight while in the upwards motion. We are also working on exacting our coding values for a 4 point autonomous. Hopefully with new alterations and improvements our robot will be successful and our goals met!",img:"https://www.ssbwiki.com/images/thumb/3/38/R.O.B._%28JPN%29_SSBU.png/600px-R.O.B._%28JPN%29_SSBU.png"}),o.a.createElement(N,{members:e}),o.a.createElement(S,{color:"#1c1c1c",title:"About the team",body:"Introducing 4549C!

We faced a lot of problems with this design as apart from being massive and slow, the cubes slide down the tray as the stacks increases up to 5 cubes. To solve this problem we are going to remove the lift and hopefully that would decrease the mass as well as the tray angle and would allow us to stack cubes successfully.

During a skills run, your robot has the entire field to itself and has 1minute to score as many points as possible.
