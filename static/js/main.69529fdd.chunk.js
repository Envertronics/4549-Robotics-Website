We faced a lot of problems with this design as apart from being massive and slow, the cubes slide down the tray as the stacks increases up to 5 cubes. To solve this problem we are going to remove the lift and hopefully that would decrease the mass as well as the tray angle and would allow us to stack cubes successfully.

Finally, the match is scored after the driver control period is over and the winning alliance is announced shortly. The other way to compete is to participate in the skills challenge. During a skills run, your robot has the entire field to itself and has 1minute to score as many points as possible.
