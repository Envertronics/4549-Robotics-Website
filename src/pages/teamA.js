We also had a high sportsmanship ranking.",

We are prioritizing stacking cubes over placing them in towers based on the philosophy that the towers arenâ€™t actually worth anything, but add to the stacks you have. Despite this, we can stack 9 cubes, and still access 6 out of the 7 towers. Our current project {Project Alpha 2.1}, is broken down into 9 Components and 5 Elements. The Components are the; drive, supports, tray, angler, arms, intakes, anti-tips, tracking wheels, and tech. The 5 Elements are; spacing, release mechanism, rubber banding, materials and resources.The Components make up the robot and complete its functions while the Elements are encompassed throughout the Components and are aspects that need to be considered when creating a design."

Sajan is our Web Designer, Programmer, and Documenter; his knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and  Python serves as a base for his Vex (C++) programming. Jackie is our Lead Designer, Driver, and Builder; his previous CAD experience led him to his current roles. Huy is our Lead Builder, Designer, and Scout;  he has been building for 4 years originating from the Vex IQ Challenge. Satvik is our Lead Programmer, Builder, and Designer; he has taken multiple engineering-related courses throughout highschool which inspired him to join the program. Owen is our Lead Documenter and Lead Scout; his previous experience with visual arts and interest for drafting led him to take care of the notebook. We have grown together and have become close friends through the Vex Robotics Competition."
